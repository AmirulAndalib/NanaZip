# NanaZip.Project

Some MSBuild configurations shared by whole NanaZip project.

## Note of precompiled binaries

For out-of-box NanaZip building experience, it's necessary.

Although all precompiled binaries is already open-sourced, but contributors may
don't know where is the source code. It's necessary to notice that.

Here are the notes:

- Mile.Project.Helpers.dll
  - https://github.com/ProjectMile/Mile.Project.Helpers
- NanaZip.Build.Tasks.dll
  - https://github.com/M2Team/NanaZip/tree/main/NanaZip.Build.Tasks
  - You can open NanaZip.MaintainerTools.sln at NanaZip source code root folder
    to build this.
