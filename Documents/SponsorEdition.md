# NanaZip Sponsor Edition

NanaZip provides $99.99 Sponsor Edition addon to the Microsoft Store for attract
more sponsors and contributors.

It's free for NanaZip source code repository contributors and NanaZip sponsors
who sponsored before March 30, 2024.

## Feature

The only difference for NanaZip Sponsor Edition is showing "Proudly Sponsored"
button instead of "Sponsor NanaZip" button in the next stable version of
NanaZip's toolbar like the Visual Studio administrator mode.

## Purpose

Hope every NanaZip users happier than before. Here are some imagination
examples.

- Most users: We are happy with using a $99.99 product freely without feature 
  differences.
- Contributors: We want to show "Proudly Sponsored" button to others. It's free
  because we are the contributors. Contribute it if you want to get that free.
- Sponsors: We can show "Proudly Sponsored" button to others because we deserve
  that.
- The author of NanaZip, Kenji Mouri: Finally, NanaZip has the price. Nobody 
  will think this is a worthless product. Efforts from contributors and I should
  have a reference price even NanaZip is a fully free and open source project.
